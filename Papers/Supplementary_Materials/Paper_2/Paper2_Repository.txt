  1. About This Repository

  This OSF project contains the primary manuscript for Paper 2, its supporting supplementary materials, and the artefacts required to understand or replicate the LC-OS protocols used in long-term human–AI work.
  The supplementary materials also fulfil previously stated artefact commitments from Paper 1.
  
  2. File List

  Primary Files

* Paper_2_Lean_Collaboration_OS_vFINAL.pdf
  Final published-ready version of the paper.
* Paper_2_Lean_Collaboration_OS_vFINAL.docx
  Editable manuscript (author version).

  Supplementary Materials

* Supplemental_Materials.docx

  One document containing:
o LC-OS Operational Checklist
o Worked Transparent Tracing Example
o Version / Checksum Log Snippet

  These materials support both Paper 1 and Paper 2.

  Paper 1 (Reference)

* Paper_1_FINAL_arXiv-OSF_vSUBMIT.pdf
  Final archived version of Paper 1, referenced within the Paper 2 manuscript.
  
  3. Purpose of the Supplement Pack

  The supplementary materials deliver:

* the operational LC-OS toolkit in a compact form,
* one drift ->  detection -> repair demonstration,
* a lightweight version/log example as promised in Paper 1,
* minimal artefacts required to understand the system’s workflow.

  These materials are intentionally lightweight to remain accessible and reusable for future research in long-form human–AI collaboration.
  
  4. Contact / Requests

  Additional non-personal data or artefacts referenced in the manuscripts (e.g., structural documents, pseudocode, or example logs) are available upon reasonable request.
