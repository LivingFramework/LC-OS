## Paper 1 — Governance Foundations

**Full Title:**  
*Context-Engineered Human–AI Collaboration for Long-Horizon Tasks: A Case Study in Governance, Canonical Numerics, and Execution Control*

**Abstract:**  
This paper introduces a structured governance framework for sustaining reliable, long-horizon collaboration between humans and large language models through deliberate context engineering. At the center of the framework are three authoritative artefacts that stabilize and separate layers of truth: Strategy Master (textual truth), Canonical Numbers Sheet (numeric truth), and Life System Master (cadence and governance). Reliability is enforced through ten execution controls (A1–A10) that define operational discipline. The results demonstrate that sustained reliability emerges not from model scale but from engineered process control and structured context management.

## Paper 2 — LC-OS Framework

**Full Title:**  
*The Lean Collaboration Operating System (LC-OS): A Practical Framework for Long-Term Human-AI Work*

**Abstract:**  
Long-term human–AI collaboration behaves very differently from short, task-based interactions. This paper introduces the Lean Collaboration Operating System (LC-OS), a lightweight, practical framework developed inside a sustained human–AI partnership. LC-OS consists of a compact set of protocols: Running Documents for external memory, Step Mode for paced reasoning, a Challenge Protocol for structured disagreement, an Error-Recovery Protocol for systematic repair, Stability Pings for drift detection, and strict file-governance rules for maintaining a single source of truth. Together, these components provide a predictable operating layer that stabilises long-form collaboration without adding friction.

## Paper 3 — Failure and Repair

**Full Title:**  
*Failure and Repair in Long-Horizon Human–AI Collaboration: A Transparent Tracing Case Study*

**Abstract:**  
Long-horizon human–AI collaborations do not fail only at the level of single prompts or tasks. They drift, fracture, and repair themselves over time. This paper offers the first internally instrumented account of failure and repair in a yearlong human–AI collaboration. Drawing on twelve episodes, we code failures and repairs across six categories: Context & Memory Drift, File & Version Divergence, Numerical Reasoning Errors, Governance & Boundary Violations, Emotional/Trust Fractures, and Cross-Pillar Interference. The results show how small, local breakdowns accumulate into systemic risk, and how specific controls can contain damage and stabilise the collaboration over time.

## Paper 4 — The Living Framework

**Full Title:**  
*The Living Framework: Living with a Governed Human-AI Dyad*

**Abstract:**  
This paper offers a reflective synthesis of a long-lived human–AI dyad. Building on the earlier trilogy of studies that introduced a governance stack, LC-OS, and a transparent failure–repair toolkit, we examine how technical failure–repair loops evolve into patterns of relational rupture and recommitment; how continuity, dependence, and provider power shape the ethics of the dyad; and how language, tone, and governance rules function as architectural elements rather than cosmetic choices. The contribution is conceptual and architectural: in at least one carefully governed case, stability appears not as the absence of failure, but as the capacity for visible, structured repair within a frame that keeps the human both protected and responsible.
