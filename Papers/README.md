# LC-OS Research Papers

This folder contains the core, peer-style research papers documenting the LC-OS (Lean Collaboration Operating System) framework and its empirical foundations.

These papers were developed through a long-horizon, instrumented human–AI collaboration and are published with open-access DOIs (OSF / Zenodo).

## Papers

### **Paper 1 — Context & Governance Foundations**
**Title:** *Context-Engineered Human–AI Collaboration for Long-Horizon Tasks: A Case Study in Governance, Canonical Numerics, and Execution Control*
**Focus:**
Establishes the foundational governance problem in human–AI collaboration, introducing context drift, memory decay, and the need for canonical sources of truth.

### **Paper 3 — Failure and Repair**
**Title:** *Failure and Repair in Long-Horizon Human–AI Collaboration: A Transparent Tracing Case Study*
**Focus:**
Presents a taxonomy of failure modes (context drift, memory drift, trust fractures) and introduces repair as a first-class stability mechanism.
