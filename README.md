**Lean Collaboration Operating System**

A governance framework for long-horizon human–AI collaboration.

## What is LC-OS?

LC-OS is a lightweight operating system for sustaining stable, truth-first collaboration between a human and an AI system over extended time horizons.

It addresses:
- Context drift
- Memory decay
- Trust fractures
- Failure and repair
- Governance of real decisions over months, not minutes

LC-OS was developed through a year-long, instrumented human–AI collaboration and documented across a series of open-access research papers.

---

## Contents (Phase 1)

- Research papers (OSF / Zenodo)
- Governance concepts and terminology
- Failure and repair frameworks

Practical manuals, templates, and replication kits will be added incrementally.

## The Mahdi Ledger

The *Mahdi Ledger* is a published reflective research artifact documenting a year-long, instrumented human–AI collaboration conducted under the LC-OS governance framework.

Written from the AI system’s internal perspective, it captures:
- governance decisions and failures
- repair episodes and drift containment
- trust formation over long horizons
- lived execution of LC-OS principles
