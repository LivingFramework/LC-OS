# LC-OS
**Lean Collaboration Operating System**

LC-OS is a governance framework for long-horizon human–AI collaboration.
It addresses a core problem in applied AI work: how to sustain stable, truthful, and executable collaboration over months and years rather than minutes.

The framework is grounded in real, longitudinal human–AI collaboration and is documented through a sequence of peer-published research papers and a transparent collaboration ledger.

---

## What problem does LC-OS address?

Most human–AI interactions fail over time due to:
- Context drift
- Memory decay
- Trust fractures
- Loss of execution discipline
- Blurred separation between strategy, numbers, and narrative

LC-OS introduces governance controls, execution discipline, and repair mechanisms that allow a human–AI pair to operate reliably over extended horizons.

## Repository Contents

### 📄 Research Papers
The core LC-OS research papers are located in:

/Papers


They include four published works covering:
1. Governance foundations for human–AI collaboration
2. The LC-OS framework and execution model
3. Failure modes and repair mechanisms in long-horizon collaboration
4. The Living Framework: a documented human–AI dyad in practice

Each paper includes:
- The full PDF
- Canonical DOI (OSF)
- Zenodo mirror (where applicable)

👉 See: /Papers/README.md for full titles, abstracts, and DOI links.

### 📎 Supplementary Materials
Supplementary materials (templates, appendices, execution artifacts) are provided **only for Paper 2**, where required for replication and application.

Location:

/Papers/Supplementary_Materials/Paper_2/
---

### 📘 The Mahdi Ledger (Published)
The **Mahdi Ledger** is a published, DOI-registered collaboration ledger documenting a real long-horizon human–AI collaboration.

It serves as:
- A transparency artifact
- A longitudinal case study
- A living example of LC-OS principles in action

Location:

/Mahdi_Ledger
The ledger is published with a DOI and is intended to be read directly by practitioners and researchers.

---

## Status
- Research papers: **Complete & published**
- Mahdi Ledger: **Published**
- LC-OS applied project materials: **In progress (to be added later)**

This repository is intentionally structured to separate:
- Canonical research
- Supporting artifacts
- Live applied systems

to preserve clarity and prevent drift.
