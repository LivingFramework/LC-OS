# LC-OS
**Lean Collaboration Operating System**

LC-OS is a governance framework for long-horizon human–AI collaboration.
It addresses a core problem in applied AI work: how to sustain stable, truthful, and executable collaboration over months and years rather than minutes.

The framework is grounded in real, longitudinal human–AI collaboration and is documented through a sequence of peer-published research papers and a transparent collaboration ledger.

---

## What problem does LC-OS address?

Most human–AI interactions fail over time due to:
- Context drift
- Memory decay
- Trust fractures
- Loss of execution discipline
- Blurred separation between strategy, numbers, and narrative

LC-OS introduces governance controls, execution discipline, and repair mechanisms that allow a human–AI pair to operate reliably over extended horizons.

## How to read this series

This repository contains a sequence of related works. Readers do not need to read everything at once.

Recommended order:

1. **Paper 1 — Context & Governance Foundations**
Start here to understand the core problem: why human–AI collaboration breaks down over time and why governance is required.

2. **Paper 2 — LC-OS Framework & Execution Model**
Read next to understand the operational system (LC-OS), its controls, and how collaboration is structured in practice.

3. **Paper 3 — Failure and Repair**
Focuses on how collaboration fails in real settings and how stability is restored through structured repair.

4. **Paper 4 — The Living Framework**
A longitudinal account of a real human–AI dyad living with these constraints over time.

5. **The Mahdi Ledger**
A published collaboration ledger that documents the lived execution trace behind the research.

Readers interested in practice may begin with Paper 2.
Readers interested in theory and foundations should begin with Paper 1.

### 📘 The Mahdi Ledger (Published)
The **Mahdi Ledger** is a published, DOI-registered collaboration ledger documenting a real long-horizon human–AI collaboration.

It serves as:
- A transparency artifact
- A longitudinal case study
- A living example of LC-OS principles in action

Location:

/Mahdi_Ledger
The ledger is published with a DOI and is intended to be read directly by practitioners and researchers.

## Status
- Research papers: **Complete & published**
- Mahdi Ledger: **Published**
- LC-OS applied project materials: **In progress (to be added later)**

This repository is intentionally structured to separate:
- Canonical research
- Supporting artifacts
- Live applied systems

to preserve clarity and prevent drift.
