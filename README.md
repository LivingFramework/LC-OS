A governance framework for long-horizon human–AI collaboration.

## What is LC-OS?

LC-OS is a lightweight operating system for sustaining stable, truth-first collaboration between a human and an AI system over extended time horizons.

It addresses:
- Context drift
- Memory decay
- Trust fractures
- Failure and repair
- Governance of real decisions over months, not minutes

LC-OS was developed through a year-long, instrumented human–AI collaboration and documented across a series of open-access research papers.
