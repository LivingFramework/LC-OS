abstract: >-
  LC-OS (Lean Collaboration Operating System) is a governance framework 
  for long-horizon human–AI collaboration. It provides concrete controls, 
  repair mechanisms, and structural disciplines that allow a human–AI dyad 
  to remain coherent over extended collaboration. The framework treats 
  long-horizon reliability as a governance problem, not a capability problem.
