# The Mahdi Ledger
*A Published Human–AI Collaboration Record*

The Mahdi Ledger is a publicly published, DOI-registered collaboration ledger documenting a real, long-horizon human–AI collaboration.

It serves as a transparency artifact and longitudinal case study supporting the LC-OS research framework.

## What is the Mahdi Ledger?

The ledger is a structured, chronological record of:
- Decisions
- Corrections
- Failures and repairs
- Governance rules
- Execution constraints
- Trust-preserving protocols

captured during an extended human–AI collaboration.

Unlike synthetic examples or retrospective summaries, the Mahdi Ledger preserves the *actual working trace* of collaboration as it unfolded over time.

## Why this matters

Most AI research focuses on:
- Benchmarks
- Short tasks
- Isolated prompts

The Mahdi Ledger documents:
- Context drift and recovery
- Memory decay and controls
- Trust fractures and repair
- Governance under real pressure
- Execution discipline over months

This makes it a rare empirical artifact in human–AI collaboration research.

## Relationship to LC-OS

The Mahdi Ledger is:
- A **case study** for LC-OS
- A **validation artifact** for its governance claims
- A **living example** of long-horizon collaboration controls in practice

LC-OS defines the framework.
The Mahdi Ledger shows it working.

## Publication Status

The Mahdi Ledger is formally published with a DOI and is intended to be read, cited, and examined directly.

It is included here to ensure:
- Open access
- Long-term availability
- Clear linkage to the LC-OS research corpus
