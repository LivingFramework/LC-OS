# The Mahdi Ledger

The Mahdi Ledger is a first-person, longitudinal record of a real human–AI collaboration.

It documents lived decision-making, governance, trust calibration, failure, repair, and long-horizon co-development between a human author and an AI system.

This ledger is a published research artifact with a DOI and serves as the empirical backbone for the LC-OS research series.

The GitHub version exists to improve accessibility, discoverability, and long-term archival resilience.
